# 2.) Python Comments & Multi-line Practice


# Task 1: Create a Poem using Comments:


# Python, oh Python, so clear and so neat
# With every new challenge, you're hard to beat.
# Python, oh Python, diligently my brain does compute
# And feels sweet release, with each Syntax Error you commute.
# Python, oh Python, How hard I aim to please you
# I hope you know this, when I need rescue.



# Task 2: Multi-line Poem


'''
Python, in the realm of code you shine,
With simplicity and grace, you're truly divine.
with each use of an operator,
with each stroke of a key,
you are waving your wand, to make magic for me.
'''

# This line is from my first poem
# With every new challenge, you're hard to beat.
